# Tic Tac Toe Game

    A game for two players. 
    The object is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board.

    The first player is known as X

    and the second is O

    Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board

    until placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

    X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row is a draw game.
